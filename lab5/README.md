# Reliance on Security Through Obscurity

This lab shows how to easy reverse android apps. The software uses a protection mechanism which depends in common on its obscurity. Knowledge of its algorithms or key data is sufficient to defeat the mechanism. This reliance on "security through obscurity" can lead to weaknesses if an attacker is able to reverse engineer the mechanism.

## Core idea
You have android application, you need to find out the key.
